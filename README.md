# Campus-Smart-Cafe

A simulation of a computer-driven dining hall system. Allows each student to locate dining halls on a campus map, 
purchase food and keep track of daily expenditures, monitor daily calorie intake, and be warned if they are purchasing 
food they are allergic to. 

Written in Java. Persistence through File I/O to text files. 

The easiest way to use is to download OOP.jar, along with all the text files, and put them in the same folder. 
Then, run the jar. The ID number/Password combinations that will work are (located in the "CardDatabase.txt": 

1234, abc123
4567, abc456
7890, abc789

From that point, you can click on the location of the vending machine or dining halll, add funds to the card, purchase food,
or view your calorie intake, allergies, and monthly expenditures. 

The various screens of the GUI are in the 4 image files.
